								<p>With the first half of capstone completed, here are some thoughts on how the first half went and some of our expectations and goals for the second half.

									<p>The first half of capstone went by incredibly fast. It feels as though just yesterday we were doing the game pitches. The first half went kind of rough to be honest. While we got a prototype for the game, I feel as though it could have been a lot better. It was my first time trying to implement a wall run in a game and I feel like the physics of the whole thing were throwing me off. The gun has the function to shoot projectiles and can also heal the player, but I will be thinking of a third function to add some variety in the game. The original scope included a few different functions, but we may have to scale that back to meet the deadline and produce a decent demo. 
										<br>
										As we enter the second half of capstone, my goal will be to first clean up the movement script so that the character isn’t so floaty. Next, I will be focused on the players weapon and implementing animations for the player and enemies. Animation isn’t my strong suit so I will be budgeting my time to allow myself enough time to get everything working correctly. Reid and I will go through our scripts to ensure that everything works well together and fix any bugs that come up in developments. The second half is the time where we will need to polish the game and we have quite a bit to do but I am confident we will succeed.
