								<p>In the year 3030, the terrorist group which goes by the name of Hyper-Light Fanatics (HLF), has opposed the New Earth Union (NEU) for several decades. The Hyper-Light Fanatics stand against what the New Earth Union has become, calling them corrupt and unjust overlords of the common people. The Hyper-Light Fanatics have cost the New Earth Union billions in sabotage and trade route ambushes. The New Earth Unionâ€™s military has been working on a new weapon that could change the way battles are fought and set a new precedent for law and order. This weapon has the functionality of a complete arsenal as well as utility tools that give the user new ways of combat and infiltration. The military has selected a highly decorated combatant who has taken down countless Hyper-Light Fanatics and is sending them on a secret mission to take down the head of the Hyper-Light Fanatics organization. With this disruption in power, the New Earth Union hopes it can cause enough destabilization and cowardice in the Hyper-Light Fanatics ranks to finally get the foothold they need to wipe out the Hyper-Light Fanatics entirely.
