								<p>With the first half of capstone completed, here are some thoughts on how the first half went and some of our expectations and goals for the second half.
								</p>

								<h3>Bukhari</h3>
									<p>The first half of capstone was definitely an interesting and eye opening experience. For our project, I was tasked with creating environment art for the project. I was a little nervous since I'm used to character designing and texturing more. However, the process became easier when I decided to sketch out the environment before modeling. In the past, I used to go right into modeling without any sort of reference; which definitely caused me to struggle quite a few times. Luckily the game had a neon aesthetic which I have done multiple times in the past for both characters and environment assets. I would like to get more familiar with Unity's shaders before the second half of capstone so that I can assist my teammates more. During the part of capstone some challenges I experienced were microphone problems, meeting deadlines while dealing with a sudden onslaught of home issues, copping with a love one passing away, and a massive decline in motivation due to in real life events. Recently I've gotten myself together and I hope to do my part in the project even better during the second part of capstone. I plan on ensuring that my microphones are properly running, and that I communicate better with the team so that they are aware of why my effort and attendance may be lack luster at times. "</p>

									<p>The first half of capstone went by incredibly fast. It feels as though just yesterday we were doing the game pitches. The first half went kind of rough to be honest. While we got a prototype for the game, I feel as though it could have been a lot better. It was my first time trying to implement a wall run in a game and I feel like the physics of the whole thing were throwing me off. The gun has the function to shoot projectiles and can also heal the player, but I will be thinking of a third function to add some variety in the game. The original scope included a few different functions, but we may have to scale that back to meet the deadline and produce a decent demo. 
										<br>
										As we enter the second half of capstone, my goal will be to first clean up the movement script so that the character isn’t so floaty. Next, I will be focused on the players weapon and implementing animations for the player and enemies. Animation isn’t my strong suit so I will be budgeting my time to allow myself enough time to get everything working correctly. Reid and I will go through our scripts to ensure that everything works well together and fix any bugs that come up in developments. The second half is the time where we will need to polish the game and we have quite a bit to do but I am confident we will succeed.

									<h3>John</h3>
									<p> First, looking back on the general workload for this semester I have ramped up my 3D modeling productions greatly in providing character models, a wide range of environmental assets and coloring them in a way that fits our games look. I have finished the concept and 3D models of the main character as well as a sentry robot NPC. I have continued to self-learn and implement throughout this asynchronous course, as well as provide team support to those who need feedback or additional help in creating content. I have furthered my knowledge in topics such as color theory to better understand palettes and how to pair colors for more pleasing aesthetics and consistent design. Other than the 2-3 days that I had to take off due to migraines from excessive eye strain, I have not fallen behind on my milestones and even caught up and surpassed them to facilitate the teams' needs, including developing a level that fully supports and utilizes our games mechanics, as well as UI elements such as health and energy bars. I have also created a game level that is designed around our mechanics first to support interesting and engaging gameplay. This prototype level will set the standard for our games feel and can be further developed and refined into a fully composed level for our final game demo.
										[11:39 PM]
										My next steps are to finalize any UI elements that we will need such as gun energy/ammo count and possible start screen art. I will also continue to learn about products such as Substance Painter and possibly ZBrush to add details more effectively to assets made. After building the prototype level myself I was able to see how to make more effective environmental assets to replace or flesh out areas of the level for more aesthetically pleasing gameplay and player guidance. These additional assets will be modeled and implemented in the next set of iterations of the game itself. An example of this would be to create a recognizable wall that inherently lets the player know that it is a wall-running location without the player being confused as to what they need to do in certain sections. Currently, these types of level assets are represented through color-coordinated level pieces, such as red walls and yellow points of interest.
										My biggest challenges this semester was knowing how detailed to make a model so that it still fits the low-poly look we are going for, keeping consistent work hours to better balance workload on myself, and knowing what the game needed before getting hands on with the program itself.
										[11:40 PM]
										How I over came these challenges was mostly through trial and error. I tried to keep polygon counts as low as I could while still getting the idea of the model across. Some models that I made have a lot more polygons than they need but that will be refined in the second half of the class this summer. I learned that if I was able to make one or two models per workday it kept my production cycle up and the stress of cramming it all in a couple days before needed way down. Consistent but smaller work chunks also allowed me to focus on quality and polygon count efficiency for models closer to where I was more comfortable with my work. Concept art was only necessary in a couple of instances that the team should agree with together such as UI and Main Character designs. Once I got my hands on a working prototype I was able to better understand how the game was going to play and that lead me to a better idea of what models to make in the future to fulfill roles I wouldn’t have known otherwise such as making specific wall designs for wall-running as mentioned above.</p>

									<h3>Joshua</h3>
									<p>Based on our first half of working in capstone I would say that we as a team achieve our goal in making a game prototype and even though we had struggling in coding and designing our characters for the game. But I would think that we all have achieve our goals as for me I have been able to create multiple animations which can be a struggle, but I have been able to learn about how to move the character around and learned how to use different rigging techniques on the character both the main character and even the NPC character (Non-playing Characters). I Also want to say that the first half of our capstone projects has been an interesting experience because even though I have been used to using the applications that we are currently using to design our game prototype I still am learning in the processes of what it takes to complete an entire game instead of just half of it.  Also, in our first half of capstone we have had the pleasure of working with each other even though we all have met each other before in classes that we have taken together this is our first time in working with each other in designing our game. And hopefully within the future when we all find our jobs might see each other again and will be able to work with each other again in design a project for our clients.
										Now with our next expectations we plan to put our characters into use because even though we have been struggling with imputing the character in the prototype we plan to put them to use in the game and to make sure the movements or the animations of the characters fit within the games environment and can be seen by the player when playing our game. Also, in our next half of capstone I am hoping that we have a chance as well to implement Bukhari’s and My level into the game prototype with John’s because I fell as if we all have made great contributions into making our capstone project come true. And I also believe that expectations is to make sure that the characters animations also come over from Maya and into unity because the animations have a been a struggle to bring over based on the design of the character itself and to make sure that it fits within the environment of the level that was designed by John and being used for the games prototype. And lastly, our next expectations in designing our capstone project is to make sure that the game working mechanically and there are no problems with the characters, levels or even the coding itself and to make that we finalize everything to make it a great game and for it to played in a demo even though we did not do that on time we plan to make sure that it is playable and there are no problems to be seen.</p>
