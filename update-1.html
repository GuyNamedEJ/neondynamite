								<p>Milestones 1 and 2 have completed! Here are some of the updates we have so far.
								</p>

								<h3>Bukhari</h3>
									<p>Bukhari has created some nice environment and level design assets in blender that we can export into Unity. Currently, he is texturing and working on lighting the assets so that they fit the retrowave theme we are going for. He also has a skydome texture created as well.</p>

									<hr />

									<h3>EJ</h3>
									<p>EJ has the basic movement controller setup and has gotten wallrunning setup. It currently works but there are small tweaks that can be made to it which will be done by next milestone. The health system has been pushed to next milestone since the Wall running took so long. By next milestone, basic weapon functions should be implemented. </p>

									<hr />

									
									<h3>John</h3>
									<p>John has skinned and rigged the main character so that Joshua can animate it. He will be working with Joshua and Bukhari in texturing and providing additional environmental assets and characters </p>

									<hr />
									
									<h3>Joshua</h3>
									<p>Joshua is currently working on animationg the main character. He currently has animations setup for crouching, climbing, running, walking and grabbing. He has also modeled a variety of different weapons in Blender. </p>

									<hr />

								<h3>Reid</h3>
									<p>Reid has been working on the enemy AI scripts. Enemies will chase the player when in range and will go back to protrolling once out of range in the area they last saw the player. Shooting is currently being worked so that they can damage the player soon.</p>
