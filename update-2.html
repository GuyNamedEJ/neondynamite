								<p>Here are some of the updates we have so far.
								</p>

								<h3>Bukhari</h3>
									<p>Bukhari has created some nice environment and level design assets in blender that we can export into Unity. Currently, he is texturing and working on lighting the assets so that they fit the retrowave theme we are going for. He also has a skydome texture created as well.</p>

									<hr />

									<h3>EJ</h3>
									<p>EJ is working on implementing the player health system and doing some minor changes to the player controller. EJ will be working on creating the players gun functionality and getting the basic shooting mechanics implemented. Along with this, EJ will be working on some of the utilities like self healing and shielding. These are a couple of abilities that the player will be able to use and we hope to have these working soon. </p>

									<hr />

									
									<h3>John</h3>
									<p>John has created and modeled an NPC sentry robot that will be implemented as one of two current prototype enemies. The other being a humanoid NPC created by Joshua. John has also provided synthwave music to use in the game. Currently John is working on developing and modeling 7-10 environmental assets to be used in-game.</p>

									<hr />
									
									<h3>Joshua</h3>
									<p>Joshua will be modeling my NPC humanoid character and will rig and animate the character and John's sentry drone character. He will also be  working on some environment assets as well </p>

									<hr />

								<h3>Reid</h3>
									<p>Reid has been implementing the enemy AI, getting them moving around and avoiding obstacles. Reid has also gotten the enemy to switch between patrolling between points, and chasing the player when the enemy can see them. Reid is currently working on the enemy shooting AI, including gun behaviors and tracking life and ammunition.</p>
