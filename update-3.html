								<p>Here are some of the updates we have so far.
								</p>

								<h3>Bukhari</h3>
									<p>This week, I have expanded the interior level that I was working on. I have begun to add a second floor, along with new hallways and more lights. I am also trying to fix any geometry that may have any collision or normal visibility issues when importing into unity. I also started to look into neon materials and post processing bloom within unity. I plan to add a rough low-poly exterior so that players can see out of the windows.</p>

									<h3>EJ</h3>
									<p>The health system has been added. I had John create a health bar UI graphic and I am using a gradient as it texture so that it fits the theme. The gun can fire projectiles and can also be used for healing. The implementation isn’t all that great and will be improved upon. I plan to have the functions of the gun written out and then I will have them added as coded. To make the different abilities, I am going to use Scriptable Objects. This should make it much easier to implement. I have a basic idea of what each ability will need such as name, UI icon, sound, projectile prefab, etc. 

									</p>

									<h3>John</h3>
									<p>Since the previous update John has currently completed 13 environmental assets to include: Two versions of a table, Fern plant, Cup, Lift, Fence, Stairs, Shelving, Crypto ASIC miner, Stool, Light, 3D Printer, and a AC unit/ducting with fans. John has applied colored materials to these items based on a common color palette. John has also recolored the main character and the sentry robot based on the same color palette for consistency. John has also created a Health and Shield bar for the player UI HUD which has been implemented and is working accordingly.</p>

									<h3>Joshua</h3>
									<p>For this week I went in and started to add textures into the character . I am also going back into the animations that I designed in milestone 2 for the main character and fixing it to make it better for the main character to flow within the game. I am also redesigning the Boss for our level and I am going into the character and fixing and re-animating the NPC Characters such as the sentry robot and the other NPC character to make it also flow within the prototype of the game. I also worked with john on implementing and designing some of the environment assets and also adding textured to the environment assets. </p>

								<h3>Reid</h3>
									<p>This week, I implemented an enemy shooting script that aims the weapon toward the player. When the weapon is directly lined up with the player, it fires, waiting rateOfFire amount of seconds to fire again, allowing the designer to control how many bullets can be fired a second. When the enemy runs out of ammo, they reload their weapon, giving the player time to attack. 
										I also integrated EJ’s existing code with mine, allowing the enemy to take damage from the player, by checking if the player aimed and hit the enemy, and applying damage to the enemy. I still need to implement a distance dropoff rate, so that the enemy does more damage when close, and less when far. I’d also like to implement a heavy weapon, like a shotgun or a grenade launcher, with a different spread pattern, but that may involve matrix math, which I’m not familiar with.</p>
